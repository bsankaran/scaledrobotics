          <h2>Digitising construction</h2>
          <p>Construction technology has not seen any noticeable improvement in over a 100 years. Though architects today are able to design digitally with high precision, we still construct manually using the same techniques that were used over a century ago. This disconnect between digital design and the physical world has led to an economically and environmentally unsustainable construction process, furthermore producing buildings that are energy inefficient.</p>

          <p>At Scaled Robotics our mission is to digitise construction. Through the introduction of teams of mobile robots to the construction site that work directly from the 3D model, we bridge the gap between digital design and the physical construction site. This cuts out costly errors and increases quality, transitioning to a leaner manufacturing process.</p>
          <p>Backed by our lead investor and industry partner Peri, we are modernising 21st century construction.</p>
