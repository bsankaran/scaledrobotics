# Digitising construction

Construction as an industry is not working, it is wasteful and inefficient. We are still using the same tools as 100 years ago. The empire state was completed in 1931 and can you honestly say that the buildings that surround it are significantly better or worse? We have reached a point where the industry is simply not making progress.

So it’s no wonder with such little technological advancement that, 63% of the UK construction industry is operating on a 5% profit margin and 17% is losing money. There is no way that this is healthy or sustainable.

And this brings us to the root of the problem. We are designing digitally but still constructing manually. Buildings are becoming more complex, resources become more expensive, margins are getting tighter. The industry needs new tools. We can’t expect last century's tools to match the challenges we face now. Our thinking is constrained by the tools available now. So what is the solution?

At Scaled Robotics we replace these large machines with small mobile robots. We bridge the gap between digital and physical through the introduction of autonomous mobile robots to the construction site. Working directly from the digital model.
